    <h1>System Design: From Fundamentals to Practical Competence</h1>
    <p>
      This book is for experienced software engineers who have mastered the 
      beginner-level foundation and are ready to design real-world systems. 
      Over ten chapters, you’ll deepen your knowledge of building blocks, 
      communication, storage, scaling, patterns, security, observability, and 
      complete an end-to-end capstone project.

      <h2>How to Use This Book</h2>
      <p>
        The beginner-level curriculum introduced you to system design’s 
        <abbr title="Foundational terminology and mental models">vocabulary</abbr>, 
        workflows, and lightweight examples. This intermediate level takes the 
        next step: turning knowledge into competence. You will learn how to 
        evaluate design choices, weigh trade-offs, and communicate your 
        reasoning — skills that distinguish strong engineers in design reviews 
        and real-world projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Expect each chapter to blend theory, examples, and practice tasks. 
        You’ll see not just <em>how</em> to design but also <em>why</em> a 
        particular choice makes sense in context. The curriculum emphasizes 
        trade-off thinking: scalability vs. simplicity, latency vs. consistency, 
        cost vs. reliability. By practicing this mindset, you’ll grow comfortable 
        making decisions with incomplete information — the essence of practical 
        system design.
      </p>
      <p>
        Allocate about one week per chapter. Use the practice tasks as 
        self-checks, and the mastery questions to push your depth of 
        understanding. At the end, the capstone project ties everything together. 
        You’ll design and document a complex system, defending your decisions in 
        terms of trade-offs and constraints.
      </p>
      <p>
        The text is written for readability on screen, but also prints cleanly 
        for offline study. Use the navigation bar to jump between chapters, the 
        appendix, and the glossary. Each page ends with “previous/next” links 
        for sequential reading.
      </p>
      <p>
        Above all: treat this as a workbook, not just a text. Write reflections, 
        draw diagrams, and compare your answers with peers. System design is a 
        team discipline, and the more you practice explaining your reasoning, 
        the stronger you’ll become.
