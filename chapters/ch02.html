    <h1>Designing Core Building Blocks of Systems</h1>
    <p>
      Every large-scale system rests on a few essential pillars: clients, servers, APIs, 
      and middleware. This chapter develops your ability to design each block with modular 
      clarity, reason about their trade-offs, and compose them into reliable architectures.

    <!-- ============== SECTION 1: CLIENTS & FRONTENDS ============== -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>1) Clients & Frontends in System Design</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>client</strong> is any application that consumes system functionality. Clients 
        may be web browsers, mobile apps, IoT devices, or third-party integrations. Their 
        design influences server load, responsiveness, and user experience.
      </p>
      <h3>Thin vs. Thick Clients</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Thin clients</strong> delegate computation to servers. Example: a web browser 
        rendering HTML from the server. Thin clients reduce device burden but increase server 
        costs and latency. <strong>Thick clients</strong> handle logic locally—mobile apps 
        caching data, validating inputs, or rendering offline. This reduces round-trips but 
        increases update complexity and client memory use.
      </p>
      <div class="callout success">
        <strong>Trade-off:</strong> Thin clients simplify updates (deploy once to servers), 
        while thick clients improve offline reliability but require multi-platform maintenance.
      </div>
      <h3>Example</h3>
      <p>
        Consider a ride-hailing app. A thin client would request all fare calculations from 
        the server. A thick client calculates fare locally using a cached pricing model, then 
        verifies with the server. The second approach reduces latency during booking but 
        requires frequent model updates.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- ============== SECTION 2: SERVERS & APP LAYERS ============== -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>2) Servers & Application Layers</h2>
      <h3>Stateless vs. Stateful Servers</h3>
      <p>
        A <strong>stateless server</strong> does not persist user session information locally; 
        all state is externalized to caches or databases. This makes horizontal scaling easier 
        — just add servers behind a load balancer. In contrast, <strong>stateful servers</strong> 
        hold session state in memory (e.g., WebSocket chat servers). They simplify certain 
        interactions but complicate scaling and failover.
      </p>
      <p>
        Middleware like <abbr title="Session storage replicated across servers">distributed 
        session stores</abbr> (e.g., Redis) often bridge the gap by enabling state sharing.
      </p>
      <h3>Service-Oriented Thinking</h3>
      <p>
        Servers are best organized into services, each with clear <abbr title="Interface 
        that specifies how software components interact">contracts</abbr>. Monolithic servers 
        combine many concerns but reduce deployment complexity. Microservices isolate concerns 
        but increase inter-service communication overhead.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- ============== SECTION 3: API DESIGN PRINCIPLES ============== -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>3) API Design Principles</h2>
      <h3>REST vs. gRPC</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>REST</strong> APIs use human-readable JSON and are broadly interoperable. 
        They excel in public APIs and heterogeneous client ecosystems. <strong>gRPC</strong> 
        uses binary Protobufs over HTTP/2, offering compact payloads and bidirectional 
        streaming. It is optimal for high-throughput service-to-service communication but 
        requires tighter coupling of client/server tooling.
      </p>
      <h3>Versioning & Contracts</h3>
      <p>
        APIs must evolve without breaking clients. Options include path versioning 
        (<code>/v1/resource</code>), backward-compatible fields, and deprecation schedules. 
        Contracts should be explicit: OpenAPI specs, gRPC schemas, or GraphQL SDLs.
      </p>
      <div class="callout warn">
        <strong>Trade-off:</strong> REST offers simplicity and flexibility; gRPC offers 
        efficiency and strong typing. Choose based on client diversity and performance needs.
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- ============== SECTION 4: MIDDLEWARE & BROKERS ============== -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>4) Middleware & Message Brokers</h2>
      <p>
        Middleware enables decoupling. <strong>Message queues</strong> (RabbitMQ, SQS) 
        ensure reliable delivery and support retries. <strong>Streams</strong> (Kafka, 
        Pulsar) provide ordered, replayable event logs. <strong>Event buses</strong> 
        propagate state changes across services in real-time.
      </p>
      <h3>Example</h3>
      <p>
        In an e-commerce app, an order service publishes an “order placed” event to Kafka. 
        Downstream services (inventory, billing, notifications) subscribe independently. 
        This reduces coupling and isolates failures.

    <!-- ============== CASE STUDY ============== -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Case Study: Adding a Message Broker to a Social App (≈200 words)</h2>
      <p>
        A social media startup initially routes all events (posts, likes, follows) through 
        a monolithic API server that writes directly to a database. As traffic grows, 
        latency spikes and failures cascade. To decouple workloads, the team introduces 
        Kafka. Producers (API server) publish events; consumers (feed generator, analytics, 
        notifications) subscribe. This separation allows independent scaling: analytics 
        consumers can lag slightly without affecting real-time feed delivery. The broker 
        also provides durability, enabling replay for bug fixes or new features. However, 
        operational complexity increases: Kafka requires cluster management, monitoring, 
        and tuning partitions. The trade-off: improved scalability and fault isolation at 
        the cost of infrastructure overhead. The system transitions from tightly coupled 
        synchronous workflows to modular, event-driven architecture.
